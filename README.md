The application is a Pascal interpreter on Android. This application is confusing for everyone to learn Pascal on the mobile without a computer, so that we can practice anytime, anywhere.

The application is currently in working order, but it is still being actively developed. This is an interpreter so it will not be the same and will not provide all of Pascal's functionality. Do not worry, the application still fully supports most of Pascal's functions and the missing features will not matter (type cursor, for..in loop, with..do .. statement, ...)

1. The main features of the IDE:
	- Compile Pascal programs and run them without Internet.
	- Error when compiling
	- Powerful editor with many smart features: 
		★ File menu: create a new program file, open, save,automatically save file
		★ Menu edit: Undo, redo, copy, paste.
		★ Auto suggest: Display a small popup window that suggests words that coincide with the word being typed
		★ Auto format: automatically reformat the code for easier viewing.
		★ Find / Find and replace: Regular Expression support.
		★ Goto line: Move the cursor to a line.
		★ Highlight code: highlight the keywords.
		★ Code style: many interface for the editor.
		★ Font size, font, word wrap.

2. Shortcuts: (currently developing)
	- Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-X for Copy, Paste and Cut
	- Ctrl-S, Ctrl-O for File Save / Open
